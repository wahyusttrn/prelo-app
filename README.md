# Hello World!
This is Prelo App's repository.
Prelo is a secondhand e-commerce platform (taken from "Pre-loved").
This project is built under Vanilla HTML CSS JS with Bootstrap as toppings.
This project is made for Hactiv8 Phase 0 Hackathon.

## Development Rules
- the place of this `README.md` file is called `root` directory. which also consist of `index.html`, `style.css`, and `script.js`.
- to make every new page, first you'll need to make a `child` directory named after the page you wanted to make, then you can add the `html` file named `index.html` and add another `css` and `javascript` file **if needed**. (just like the `login` directory that already exist).
- you can always add another `child` directory inside the `child` directory as much as needed.
- to make it easier to maintain, i suggest you to separate the `css` and `js` files **per utilities**. that means you can make as much `css` and `js` files as needed **inside the directory related**.
- last but not least is to have fun developing! :D
